<h3> About me </h3>
 I am junior student major in General Math and General Statistic at UC Davis. I come from China, and I have come to Davis since 2014.  In the first year of UC Davis education, I focused on Mathematical proofs and calculus. In the second year, I studied C programming language R programming language. My interest is to explore data about economic and find ways to explain economic phenomenon by using statistic method. Before this I was a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at UCSD in the Mathematics department. I hold a Ph.D in Machine Learning and Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University where my advisors were Aarti Singh and Alessandro Rinaldo. In my research, I develop and study computationally efficient statistical methodology for understanding complex phenomena in large datasets.</em>
