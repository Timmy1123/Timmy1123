<h3> About me </h3>
 I am junior student major in General Math and General Statistic at UC Davis. I come from China, and I have come to Davis since 2014.  In the first year of UC Davis education, I focused on Mathematical proofs and calculus. In the second year, I studied C programming language R programming language. My interest is to explore data about economic and find ways to explain economic phenomenon by using statistic method. I also get interest with classification method, such as SVM and KNN.</em>
<h3>Data Science Work </h3>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Predict and Analysis the median house price of counties in California.(STA+141+B+Project+Final+Draft.html)<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lizhihao1212/Final-Project/blob/master/STA+141+B+Project+Final+Draft%20(2).html"> linkedin: Yunbai Zhang</a ></strong>
         <p>The house price is closely relevant to our lives. For example, the house prices in Davis dramatically increased from 2012 to               2017, and so it adds budget for education. In my project, What I did is to construct time series model to predict house price             of countries in California in 2017. Then I consider several factors to explain why some counties have relatively high house               price. We analyze from four aspects: Consumer Psychologyï¼ŒPopulation Density & House Units, Economics factors and social                   factors.</p>
     </li>
     <li><strong>Analysis the relationship between noise, schools, crime rate, parking areas, and the house price in San Francisco.(141B assignment6.ipynb) <a href="https://github.com/Timmy1123/Timmy1123"> linkedin: Yunbai Zhang</a > </strong></li>
         <p>We find out the distribution of different price level house in San Francisco. Then we want to find which is the most and least expensive. We use folium map to illustrate the distribution of parking areas, schools and high level noise area. 
</ul>
